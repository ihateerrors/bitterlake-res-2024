                The NE 130th Street Infill Station for Sound Transit’s Lynnwood
                Link Extension will provide additional service to North Seattle
                residents once complete. Explore this site for information about
                the construction of station finishes, streetscape, and roadway
                improvements over the next two and a half years. Learn more
                about what to expect as we prepare for the station to be open in
                mid-2026. The Lynnwood Link Extension project, connecting to
                service from Northgate to Lynnwood City Center Station, is
                scheduled to open for service in Fall 2024.

              <p>
                In 2016 voters approved the addition of a light rail station to
                the Lynnwood Link Extension at NE 130th St by 2031. In February
                2020, the Sound Transit Board authorized staff to complete final
                design of the station, and in summer 2022 the Board approved
                additional budget and contract changes for the accelerated
                delivery of the NE 130th Street Infill Station. This decision
                advanced opening of the new station to mid-2026, revised from
                the original 2031 opening date projected in ST3.
              </p>
              <p>
                The new station will serve a growing residential neighborhood
                between the Northgate and Shoreline South/148th stations and
                will be built within the existing Lynnwood Link Extension line.
                Once complete in mid-2026 we estimate the NE 130th Street Infill
                Station will provide approximately 3,400 daily boardings with
                access to Westlake Station in 15 minutes and SeaTac/Airport
                Station in 53 minutes.

                    The station design reflects the unique identity of this
                    neighborhood as an urban oasis, the community’s desire for a
                    modern design, and pride in nearby natural resources of
                    Thornton Creek. The design incorporates bright color and
                    art, seating areas, native landscaping, and natural elements
                    such as stormwater retention features and boulders.
                    Renderings of the final station design are included at the
                    top of this section.

                    </a>
                    in fall 2020 to the final station design. Community members
                    were asked to share their preferences for color, seating,
                    and bollards. The blue color preferred by the community was
                    used extensively throughout the station finishes, associated
                    specifically with points of vertical circulation (stairs,
                    elevators, and escalators). The seating elements include
                    both weathered boulders that reflect the station design’s
                    recognition of nearby Thornton Creek, as well as shaped
                    concrete benches located throughout the plaza areas. The
                    bollards are a modern stainless steel type with a sloped
                    top.

                      >Romson Bustillo</a
                    >, a Seattle-based artist, is developing designs for the
                    station artwork. Bustillo was born on the island of Mindanao
                    in the Philippines. His layered works and immersive
                    collaborations go back to his Philippine lineage, his South
                    Seattle/Pacific Northwest upbringing, and numerous research
                    travels. An artist selection panel made up of members from
                    the community and of art/design professionals were drawn to
                    the intricate detail in his prints and his
                    inter-disciplinary studio work, and chose Bustillo to create
                    artwork for the NE 130th Station based on his previous work
                    and his vision for the site.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The elevated station made Bustillo think of the dwellings on
                    stilts from his birth country, and this reference is one of
                    many in his iconography of patterns that incorporate
                    symbolic elements from his culture, the cultural context of
                    the station and neighborhood, and the people who inhabit it,
                    past and present. Bustillo’s intention is to create an
                    inviting work that conveys an optimistic future, supports
                    story-telling, encourages discovery, and contributes to
                    wayfinding.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the south entrance, where the majority of passengers will
                    enter the station, painted artwork will turn the guideway
                    column into a landmark that welcomes passengers as they
                    approach the station. Bustillo’s artwork will guide
                    passengers as they enter and exit the station and make their
                    way to the ticket vending machines and to the train
                    platforms. His designs will be translated into richly
                    colored, porcelain enamel panels that wrap around the
                    entrances at both north and south lobbies. The service
                    building, in the center of the station, will also be covered
                    on its east-facing side with 100-foot-long mural of
                    porcelain tiles, featuring another variation of patterns and
                    colors.

                    Romson Bustillo will be presenting to the City of Seattle’s
                    Public Art Advisory Committee on October 24 to walk through
                    some updated renderings of the artwork that will be
                    installed over the station finishes at both North and South
                    entrances, as well as the central plaza artwork. Additional
                    updates on public art at the station will be shared this
                    fall.

                        My approach is informed by research, the location of the

                        and community workshops held. I’ve considered how the

                        intimate and communal visual experiences.

                Construction of the NE 130th St Infill Station has occurred in
                phases as the Lynnwood Link Extension Project takes shape. Work
                on the station platform and canopy structural steel was
                completed, allowing operational testing prior to Lynnwood Link’s
                projected opening in fall 2024.
              </p>
              <p>
                Work is now being handed off to a different contractor that will
                complete the final package, including construction of station
                finishes, and plaza and roadway improvements. Construction and
                testing will occur between now and the opening of the station in
                mid-2026.

                <p>
                  Construction will ramp up at the site and you will see more
                  activity starting this fall/winter as we continue station
                  construction on the elevated track, at the ground-floor plaza
                  level, as well as the surrounding roadways. Construction will
                  be active through mid-2026, including testing the line at this
                  location, prior to opening this new station.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We strive to be a good neighbor and acknowledge that
                  construction can be disruptive. You can expect the following
                  during construction:

                      >The S3 Stride Line will serve the growing north Lake
                      Washington communities connecting Shoreline and Seattle to
                      Bothell. The project will connect riders to Link light
                      rail at Shoreline South/148th at the corridor’s western
                      end, and to the S2 line in Bothell, the area’s eastern
                      end. S2 and S3 will connect at the SR 522/I-405 Transit
                      Hub with transit service provided by Sound Transit,
                      Community Transit and King County Metro. Construction is
                      expected to begin in 2024, with service starting in 2027.
